# Jump-n-Ask_microbit-game
This is a simple (and fun) microbit game for school kids to experiment with and have fun at the same time.
It is written in javascript blocks using the microbit online editor, but can be easily converted to javascript code.

The game makes use of the magnetometer to use compass bearings and the led array for feedback and instructions.
At reset the player has to turn to find North. The led flashes 'N' and a tick.
You then shake it to shows a E,S,N direction to jump to. Once facing the right way you can ask a hypothetical question such as 'Is my teacher cool?'. It then gives a randon Yes, No, Maybe answer.
This is the end of the game. Press reset to re-start.

After a fresh re-flash you will need to perform compass calibration by drawing a circle with the microbit. This is a standard process.

This was a school project inteneded as a teaching but fun way to learn microbit programming.
It was written in blocks so advanced javascript code was not used.

You will find many areas that can be improved. Like being able to pass arguments to functions which I could not find how to do using blocks.

Keep in mind the fun-factor.
